# Project Introduction: Tribute to General Bipin Rawat
Project Overview
This project is my first foray into front-end web development, where I built a tribute website dedicated to the life and contributions of General Bipin Rawat, India's first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS). Through this project, I aimed to honor his legacy while developing foundational skills in HTML and CSS. The website provides a comprehensive view of General Rawat’s career, achievements, and impact on India’s defense forces, structured in a visually appealing, informative format.

About General Bipin Rawat
-> General Bipin Rawat was a decorated and respected officer in the Indian Army. Appointed as India’s first CDS, he played a pivotal role in modernizing and streamlining the country’s defense forces. His career was marked by exemplary service, strategic insight, and dedication to national security, inspiring countless individuals to pursue careers in the defense sector. This website serves as both a tribute to his legacy and a source of inspiration for those who look up to him.

Technical Skills Enhanced
-> This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in HTML and CSS:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
-> I used HTML to structure the content of the website. The biography, career highlights, achievements, and image sections were organized using semantic HTML tags for clarity and accessibility.
-> I experimented with various HTML tags and attributes to create a well-structured and accessible website.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
-> I applied CSS to style and enhance the visual appearance of the website, including color schemes, typography, spacing, and layout.
-> CSS allowed me to create a consistent look and feel for each section, balancing readability and design. I used CSS selectors, classes, and IDs to implement styling effectively.

Key Features
-> Responsive Design: I used Flexbox and basic media queries to ensure that the site displays well on both desktop and mobile devices.
-> Structured Content: I organized General Bipin Rawat's life journey in a sequential manner, making it easy for visitors to follow his story.
-> Personalized Styling: The color scheme and typography choices reflect the dignity and honor of a military leader, which I achieved by experimenting with CSS properties.

Reflection
-> Creating this website helped me understand the foundations of front-end web development. I gained confidence in HTML and CSS and was able to apply them to design a respectful, informative tribute to an inspirational figure. This project has further motivated me to learn JavaScript for interactive features, as I look forward to creating even more dynamic and engaging websites in the future.
